# crypto_clustering

## Overview
This challenge assignment was intended to reduce principle components using PCA and create an analysis for clients preparing to enter the crypocurrency market. 

## Summary

The data we pulled was not ideal, so it needed to be processed to fit into machine learning models. There is no known output, so unsupervised learning is what we used to create a clusterig algorithm and visualizations.
